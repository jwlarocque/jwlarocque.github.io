<h3>Plotting It All Together <span style="font-size: 0.78em; font-weight: 400;">(Ahaha.)</span></h3>
<p>
    That's it! Here's the combined SVG plotted to the card. I removed the stars/snowflakes (I don't think the model could decide what they were) from the outline layer as they were too small to plot effectively and just added confusion to the sky.

    This SVG was combined with the "Merry Christmas" text in Inkscape and converted to gcode with the <a href="https://github.com/plottertools/vpype-gcode"><span class="code">vpype-gcode</span></a> plugin for vpype.  
    <br/>
    I then went in and manually broke the gcode up into four files for more flexibility when plotting.
