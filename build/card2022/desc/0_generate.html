<h3>Image Generation</h3>
<p>
    The image depicted on the card was generated by the text-to-image deep learning model <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> (v1.5).  I prompted the model for images of "Christmas stars" in an ink illustrated style.

    In hindsight it was difficult to extract the "inked" lines from this image, and it probably would've been easier to try to generate an unstylized image and allow the style to arise from the plotting process.<br/>Anyways.
